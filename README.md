## About

This is a JavaScript implementation of Adaman, a solitaire game for the Decktet card system.  Both Adaman and Decktet were created by P.D. Magnus and released under a CC license.

The original JavaScript implementation was by Felbrigg Herriot, who released it under a Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike 3.0 License.  A copy of his version is saved in the initial checkin.  Subsequent changes are by M. C. DeMarco, under the same license.

## Why?

Some changes are purely cosmetic.  Some were inspired by a Java implementation of Adaman by Brian Newtz.  Most of them, though, are intended to make Adaman (and possibly other Decktet games to follow) more playable on any device, not just on Android.

Some layout fixes and the pop-up personality panel were inspired by Ori Avtalion at BGG.
