# Adaman

## About

This is a JavaScript implementation of Adaman, a solitaire game for the Decktet card system.  Both Adaman and Decktet were created by P.D. Magnus and released under a CC license.

The JavaScript implementation is by Felbrigg Herriot, who released it under a Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike 3.0 License.

All changes after the initial check-in are by M. C. DeMarco, under the same license.

## Why?

Some changes are purely cosmetic.  Some were inspired by a Java implementation of Adaman by Brian Newtz.  Most of them, though, are intended to make Adaman (and possibly other Decktet games to follow) more playable on any device, not just on Android.
